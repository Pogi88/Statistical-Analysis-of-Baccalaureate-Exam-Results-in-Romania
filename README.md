# ðŸ“Š Statistical Analysis of Baccalaureate Exam Results in Romania

## ðŸ›  Study Overview:

This study presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of the Baccalaureate exam results in Romania from 2020 to 2023. The study delves into various aspects of the exam, including performance across different demographics, the influence of educational factors, and trends over time. Advanced statistical methods were applied to uncover key insights and patterns that can inform educational policy and strategy.

**This study was conducted together with EmÅ‘ke Rafain (shecodespython on github) and Andrea Simon.**

## ðŸš€ Key Components:

### Data Collection and Preparation:

- Data was sourced from data.gov.ro and included exam results from four consecutive years (2020-2023).
- The datasets were cleaned, standardized, and transformed into structured formats for analysis.
- Both categorical and numerical data were analyzed, with a focus on variables such as gender, educational form, language, grades, and final exam status.

### Descriptive Statistics:

- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to summarize key statistics including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and frequency distributions.
- Analyzed the distribution of grades across different subjects and demographic categories, identifying trends and anomalies.

### Inferential Statistical Analysis:

- Correlation Analysis: Assessed the relationships between exam grades and their appeals, identifying strong correlations, particularly in mandatory subjects.
- T-Tests: Compared the performance between genders and educational profiles (STEM vs. Humanities), revealing statistically significant differences in various years.
- ANOVA: Analyzed variance in grades across specializations and education forms, showing significant differences in average grades among different groups.
- Regression Analysis: Applied Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to model the relationship between final scores and independent subject grades, with strong linear relationships observed.
- Chi-Square Tests: Examined associations between categorical variables (e.g., gender, profile, candidate environment) and final exam status, with significant but generally weak associations found.

### Visualizations:

- Utilized boxplots, heatmaps, and scatter plots to visualize the distribution of grades, correlations, and the results of statistical tests.
- Provided clear and insightful visual representations to support the statistical findings.

### Conclusions and Inferences:

- Gender, educational profile, specialization, form of study, environment, and native language significantly influence exam performance.
- There are observable trends over the years, such as a slight linear decrease in certain subject grades, and a consistent difference in performance based on demographic factors.

### SWOT Analysis:

- Strengths include the use of multiple inferential statistical models and visualizations.
- Opportunities exist for future analyses as new data becomes available, with potential for educational insights and policy recommendations.

## ðŸ“Š Skills Demonstrated:

- Advanced Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Inferential Statistics (Correlation, T-Tests, ANOVA, Regression, Chi-Square Tests)
- Data Visualization and Interpretation
- Application of Python and Statistical Software for Educational Data Analysis
